### General info 
My implementation of card verification, which is about validating the card number, using Luhn algorithm and several other things which indicates the card's provider.

### Technologies
Implementation created with Jest (as testing framework), ESLint (for improving syntax and enforce code style) and babel-jest (to enable the use of ES6 Modules with Jest framework). During this project, I also tried to separate functionalities into different modules in order to divide responsibilities between them. That make files more readable and flexible and that leads to better code architecture. Moreover I also wanted to create consistent commit history to show my methodology of work.
